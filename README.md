Portfolio

### Description

This project is being built focusing on using Bootstrap technology to make the web pages responsize so that when used on devices with different sized screens, the layout will still look pleasant to the user.

First I built matching Navbars on all my pages which consist of an index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html and link to a pdf of my resume. The navbar has some customization, as it has my name in white with a blueviolet background.

The following was all built inside a bootstrap grid to make it responsive to page size adjustments. Next I added an image of myself and a background for the whole website, which I later had to change as it was too big and would not display on a cell phone.

I then wrote a couple of paragraphs about myself and had to figure out how to make them wrap around my image. This was harder that I thought it would be, but accomplished as I expected I would.  I also included my GitHub link, email link, and another link to my portfolio page, and a link to my LinkedIn account. I also made the font on the whole page white, as I had a darker background image.

Next I moved to the Contact.html page. Here I used a Boostrap form and placed it in boootsrap grid to make it responsive.  This was also personalized, as I had to make the submit button match my website color theme.

Finally I worked on the Portfolio.html page.  This proved to be quite a challenge.  The challenge was getting the pictures to line up on a cell phone.  They would line up on a computer screen when you minimized it, but not on the cell phone.

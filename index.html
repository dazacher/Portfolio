          My name is Dee Ann Scanniello. I was born in South Dakota, and raised in Anaconda, Montana. When I graducated
          high school I moved to Phoenix, AZ to attend DeVry University to earn a degree as an Electronics Engineer.
          While going to school there I worked at ABC Diaper servie washing and folding baby diapers. But, as life
          would have it, a degree in Electronic Engineering wasn't happening due to financial difficulties, so I had to
          drop out of school and went to work for FotoMat. After waiting 2 years or so I finally made a decision to go
          back to school and went to Miller Institute were I got my diploma as an Electronic Technician. After
          graduating I went work for Tegal Corporation. A semiconductor Etching equipment company as a Field Service
          Engineer.</p>


        <p>I worked in the Semiconductor industry for approximately 15 years, eventually moving my way up to a Process
          Technician position at Motorla. This was a very rewarding job, as I was able to design experiments and come up
          with processes that were actually used in the manufacturing of semiconductors. I would write the
          specifications for the processing procedures, maintenance procedures, operator procedures and tests, all
          related to the process I created. Eventuall, I realized this just wasn't the career I had dreamed about. I
          wanted to program computers, so I went back to school at DeVry University and got a bachelors degree in
          Computer Information Sytems. I worked for about 4 years coding in Ada at Performance Software. Ada is a
          languare used for the aircraft industry. I realized this just wasn't what I was looking for, so I went to work
          for Risk Placement Sercives. I did a lot of SQL and some C# programming here. I really enjoyed doing this.
          After 4 years here, my husband at the time, thought I should quit working and become a stay at home mom and
          raise our than 2 year old daughter. It would save us a lot of money, and also we wouldn't have another person
          raising our child. After the divorce, I realized I wanted to go back to work and get into the field of work I
          wanted to be in when I graduated from DeVry... Web Development, so I decided to go back to school at
          University of Arizona Bootcamp for Full Stack Web Development. I truly love to code, and enjoy the challenges
          that it brings. </p>
